Here's a clean and informative section you can copy into your `README.md` for **Exercise 00**:

## 📘 Exercise 00 – First Python Script

### 🔍 Objective

Create and modify four fundamental Python data structures (`list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`) to display customized greetings based on your campus location.

### 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Python core collections: `list`, `tuple`, `set`, and `dict`
* Data mutability and immutability
* String editing and element replacement
* Printing full structures using `print()`
* Understanding how different types display in the console

### 🧪 Task Summary

You are given four predefined data objects. The goal is to update each to print the following output:

```bash
['Hello', 'World!']
('Hello', 'France!')
{'Hello', 'Paris!'}
{'Hello': '42Paris!'}
```

Each data structure must be edited accordingly while preserving the original types and format.

### 💡 Notes

* Tuples and sets require reconstruction due to immutability or lack of indexing.
* Order of elements in a `set` may vary; run multiple times to check.
* The code is written as a simple script (`Hello.py`) with no functions yet.
